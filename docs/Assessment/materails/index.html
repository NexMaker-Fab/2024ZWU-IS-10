          This makes titanium a special material for NASA rockets and satellites,
          and is used in major projects such as China&#039;s Yutu, J-20, and
          Shandong aircraft carriers.
          <br />
          In the civil field, due to the natural bacteriostatic and biophilic
          properties of titanium, it has become the &quot;honorary metal
          king&quot; of the food industry. At the same time, because titanium is
          friendly to human tissues and does not cause an immune response in the
          human body, it is also widely used in the medical field.

          1. General performance Polyethylene is a white waxy translucent
          material, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, insoluble in general solvents
          at room temperature, and has low water absorption. PE is flammable, waxy
          when burned, and is accompanied by molten dripping.
          <br />
          <br />
          2. Mechanical properties:
          <br />
          PE is a typically soft and tough polymer. Except for the high impact
          strength, the absolute value of other mechanical properties is low in
          plastic materials. With the increase of PE density, the mechanical
          properties except toughness are improved. The mechanical properties of
          several types of PE are shown in Table 1-1.

          It is a new type of composite material that has flourished at home and
          abroad in recent years, which refers to the use of polyethylene,
          polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride instead of the usual resin
          adhesive, and then through extrusion, molding, injection molding and
          other plastic processing technologies to produce plates or profiles.

          One of the most important uses of wood-plastic composites is the
          application of replacing solid wood in various fields, among which the
          most widely used is in building products, accounting for 75% of the
          total number of wood-plastic composite products. Wood-plastic composites
          are mainly used in flower boxes, tree ponds, fences, garbage cans,
          stools, chair strips, signs, etc.

          Milk plastic is a natural plastic alternative that uses discarded milk
          as the main ingredient. The plastic is made in a similar way to cheese,
          using waste milk combined with natural plasticizers to coagulate and dry
          into granular materials.

          1. Sustainability: Milk plastic uses waste milk as the main raw material
          to transform waste resources into useful products, helping to reduce the
          environmental impact of waste and reducing dependence on finite
          resources, making it more sustainable.
          <br />
          <br />
          2. Lower carbon footprint: The process of making milk plastic reduces
          CO2 emissions compared to traditional plastic manufacturing processes.
          <br />
          <br />
          3. Biodegradability: Milk plastic is more similar to natural materials
          in structure, so it can be more easily decomposed by microorganisms,
          reducing pollution to the environment. In contrast, traditional
          synthetic plastics typically take hundreds of years or more to degrade.
          <br />
          <br />
          4. Diversity and plasticity: Milk plastic has similar properties to
          traditional plastics, and can be made into products of various shapes
          and uses through different processing methods, including containers,
          tableware, household items, etc. In addition, it can also be latheized
          and machined like wood, with a wider range of application prospects.
          <br />
          <br />
          5. Reduced dependence on fossil fuels: Making milk plastic does not
          require the use of fossil fuels as a feedstock, so it can reduce
          dependence on finite fossil resources and reduce the damaging impact on
          the environment.

          Aluminum foam plate is made of pure aluminum or aluminum alloy after
          adding additives, through the foaming process, which has both metal and
          bubble characteristics, and the surface of the aluminum plate has a
          dense porous metal structure, which is the largest morphological feature
          of this material. Aluminum foam board provides more choices for
          architects due to its stable quality, unique appearance, strong
          functionality, and wide variety of specifications, and is often used in
          a large area in the interior and exterior walls of buildings, indoor
          floors and other scenes, and the material is easy to process and
          install.

          Because of the special structure formed in the production process, the
          foam aluminum sheet has good sound absorption performance, even in the
          humid environment of the bathroom and toilet, the material still
          maintains a good sound absorption and noise reduction effect, which is
          more than double the noise reduction effect of other sound absorption
          materials.

          The foam aluminum plate is made of aluminum alloy die-casting, and after
          breaking, it can be fully recycled, which is a new type of green and
          environmentally friendly high-tech product that does not cause secondary
          pollution to the environment.

          <br />
          7.Fire performance
          <br />
          The porous structure of aluminum foam forms a large number of closed
          pores, which have good thermal insulation properties and can effectively
          isolate high or low temperatures. Therefore, aluminum foam is widely
          used in the field of thermal insulation materials, such as construction,
          refrigerator manufacturing, etc. At the same time, aluminum foam has
          good fire performance, is not easy to burn, and can effectively slow
          down the spread of fire.

      3.the impact resistance is different
      <br />
      ● PC tube: It has excellent impact resistance and is a high-toughness
      material that retains good impact resistance even under extreme temperature
      conditions.
      <br />
      ● PVC Pipe: The impact resistance is poor, and it is easy to crack or break
      when impacted, especially in low temperature environments.
      <br />
      4.the bending strength is different
      <br />
      ● PC tube: It has good bending strength and can withstand a certain degree
      of bending and deformation without breaking.
      <br />
      ● PVC Pipe: The bending strength is relatively low, and it is easy to deform
      and crack when subjected to external forces;
      <br />
      5. The applicable temperature range is different
      <br />
      ● PC tube: It has a wide temperature range and is generally able to operate
      normally from -40°C to -130°C. (Generally starts to soften at around 140°C)
      <br />
      ● PVC Pipe: It is generally suitable for temperatures ranging from 0°C to
      60°C.
      <br />
      6. the weather resistance is different
      <br />
      ● PC tube: It has good UV resistance, is not easy to age and become brittle
      under sun exposure, and is suitable for long-term outdoor use.
      <br />
      ● PVC Pipe: It is less resistant to ultraviolet rays and can age, become
      brittle, and discolored when exposed to sunlight for a long time.
      <br />
      7. Different application fields
      <br />
      ● PC tube: It is often used to protect pipes with wires and cables in
      high-strength, impact-resistant environments, and is widely used in
      lighting, medical, electronics, and other fields due to its highly
      transparent properties. ● PVC Pipe: It is mainly used for drainage, sewage
      and farmland irrigation, wire and cable protection in residential,
      commercial buildings and industrial facilities.
      <br />
      8. The cost is different
      <br />
      ● PC tube: Polycarbonate resin is a high-performance plastic, the market
      price is high, and the production process is relatively complex, so the cost
      is high.
      <br />
      ● PVC Pipe: Polyvinyl chloride resin is a common plastic raw material, the
      price is relatively stable, and the production process is relatively simple,
      so the cost is low. The above nine points are the overall comparison of PC
      pipe (polycarbonate pipe) and PVC pipe (hard PVC pipe), in addition, for the
      flame retardant performance of the two, I personally feel that the flame
      retardant is quite strong, and it can be extinguished from the fire, so the
      flame retardant performance is not listed separately for comparison.

      （Plastics (塑料） we mentioned above）
      <br />
      <br />
      a. Products that can be made of plastic（塑胶）
      <br />
      1. Toys: Plastic toy vehicles, toy animals, toy figures, etc. are all common
      plastic products.
      <br />
      2. Household items: such as plastic cutlery (bowls, plates, cups), plastic
      storage boxes, plastic vases, etc.
      <br />
      3. Electronic devices: The parts of many electronic devices are made of
      plastic, such as mobile phone cases, keyboards, headphones, etc.
      <br />
      4. Sports products: such as plastic treadmills, plastic basketball courts,
      plastic fitness paths, etc.
      <br />
      5. Packaging materials: Many goods use plastic packaging during
      transportation and storage in order to maintain their freshness and
      aesthetics.
      <br />
      <br />
      b. the classification of plastics （塑胶）
      <br />
      1. Polypropylene (PP): This material is commonly used to make buckets, food
      containers, pipes, etc. Because it has high heat and cold resistance, it is
      ideal for making food-related containers. For example, the yogurt cups and
      beverage bottles we commonly use are made of polypropylene.
      <br />
      2. Polyethylene (PE): This material is widely used to make films, pipes,
      bags, etc. Because it has good corrosion resistance, it is often used as a
      packaging material. For example, the plastic bags we use when shopping are
      made of polyethylene.
      <br />
      3. Polystyrene (PS): This material is commonly used to make bowls, plates,
      and cups, among other things. Because it has a good hardness and gloss, it
      is often used to make beautiful tableware.
      <br />
      4. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) :P VC is a relatively common plastic material,
      which is often used to make water pipes, door and window guards,
      children&#039;s toys, etc. It is also widely used in the manufacture of some
      insulated electrical components.
      <br />
      5. Polycarbonate (PC): This material is often used to make some of the more
      advanced containers, such as computer cases and coffee makers. It has great
      durability and impact resistance, and is able to withstand drastic changes
      in temperature.
      <br />
      6. Polyoxymethylene (POM): This material is often used to make some parts
      with special properties, such as high-efficiency bearings and gears. It has
      high hardness and good wear resistance.

          , the material is lightweight, the density is half of that of glass,
          when used in the home, it can give the space a certain sense of
          lightness and agility, and it will not be heavy when used.

          <br />
          b.Reasons for favoring 
          <br />
          1.Wide range of applications.
          <br />
          Due to the superior performance of acrylic itself, in addition to being
          used as a variety of interior decoration, it can also be used to create
          a partial appearance of buildings, or used to make doors and windows on
          vehicles.
          <br />
          2.Beautiful and stylish
          <br />
          For different home styles, acrylic furniture or decorations can find
          their own home and blend in well.
          <br />
          And the texture of its material is as rich and varied as it is presented
          itself, with mirror panels, pearlescent plates, frosted boards and other
          options, and the spatial effects presented by each texture also have
          their own merits.
          <br />
          In the process of integrating into the space, choosing a random texture
          of furniture or decorations is enough to create a focal point for the
          space and make the whole space look beautiful and stylish.

          <br />
          (1) Casting molding:
          <br />
          Casting molding is used to form plexiglass plates, rods and other
          profiles, that is, to form profiles by bulk polymerization method.
          <br />
          (2) Injection molding:
          <br />
          Injection molding uses pellets obtained by suspension polymerization,
          which are molded on ordinary plunger or screw injection molding
          machines.
          <br />
          (3) Extrusion:
          <br />
          Polymethyl methacrylate can also be extruded to prepare plexiglass
          plates, rods, pipes, sheets, etc. with pellets produced by suspension
          polymerization, which has the advantage of high production efficiency,
          especially for pipes and other profiles that are difficult to
          manufacture with molds when pouring method.
          <br />
          (4) Thermoforming:
          <br />
          Thermoforming is the process of making plexiglass sheets or sheets into
          products of various sizes and shapes, clamping the blanks cut into the
          required size on the mold frame, heating to soften them, and then
          pressurizing them to make them stick to the mold profile to obtain the
          same shape as the profile, and trimming the edge after cooling and
          shaping to obtain the product.
          <br />
          (5) Engraving and cutting:
          <br />
          It is mainly for the hollowing and engraving of acrylic or colored
          acrylic materials that have been formed. Ordinary laser engraving and
          cutting machines can meet the engraving and hollowing needs of most
          acrylic products

          Electrophoresis (EP) is an abbreviation for electrophoresis phenomenon,
          which refers to the phenomenon in which charged particles move towards
          electrodes opposite to their electrical properties under the action of
          an electric field. The technique of separating charged particles by
          moving at different speeds in an electric field is called
          electrophoresis.

      The general process flow of anodic electrophoresis is as follows:
      <br />
      workpiece pretreatment (degreasing→ hot water washing→ rust removal→ cold
      water washing→ phosphating→ hot water washing →passivation) → anode
      electrophoresis → post-treatment of the workpiece (washing with water →
      drying).
      <br />
      <br />
      1. Degreasing. The solution is generally a hot alkaline chemical degreasing
      solution, the temperature is 60 °C (steam heating), and the time is about
      20min.
      <br />
      2. Wash with hot water. The temperature is 60 °C (steam heating), and the
      time is 2min.
      <br />
      3. Rust removal. With H2SO4 or HCl, e.g. with hydrochloric acid rust
      remover, HCl total acidity ≥ 43 points; Free acidity&gt; 41 points; Add 1.5%
      cleaning agent; Wash at room temperature for 10~20min.
      <br />
      4. Wash in cold water. Wash with cold water in running water for 1min.
      <br />
      5. Phosphating. Phosphate at medium temperature (phosphating at 60 °C for
      10min), and the phosphate solution can be used as a commercially available
      product. The above process can also be replaced by sandblasting → washing.
      6. Passivation. With the drug matched with the phosphate solution (provided
      by the manufacturer selling the phosphate solution), 1~2min at room
      temperature.
      <br />
      7. Anode electrophoresis. Electrolyte composition: H08-1 black
      electrophoretic paint, solid content 9%~12%, distilled water mass fraction
      88%~91%. Voltage: (70±10)V; Time: 2~2.5min, Paint temperature: 15~35°C,
      Paint pH: 8~8.5. Note that the workpiece in and out of the groove should be
      powered off. During electrophoresis, the current gradually decreases as the
      paint film thickens.
      <br />
      8. Wash with water. Wash under cold running water.
      <br />
      9. Drying. It can be baked in the oven at a temperature of (165±5) °C for
      40~60min.
