        In the civil field, due to the natural bacteriostatic and biophilic
        properties of titanium, it has become the &quot;honorary metal
        king&quot; of the food industry. At the same time, because titanium is
        friendly to human tissues and does not cause an immune response in the
        human body, it is also widely used in the medical field.

        1. General performance Polyethylene is a white waxy translucent
        material, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, insoluble in general solvents
        at room temperature, and has low water absorption. PE is flammable, waxy
        when burned, and is accompanied by molten dripping.
        <br />
        <br />
        2. Mechanical properties:
        <br />
        PE is a typically soft and tough polymer. Except for the high impact
        strength, the absolute value of other mechanical properties is low in
        plastic materials. With the increase of PE density, the mechanical
        properties except toughness are improved. The mechanical properties of
        several types of PE are shown in Table 1-1.

        It is a new type of composite material that has flourished at home and
        abroad in recent years, which refers to the use of polyethylene,
        polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride instead of the usual resin
        adhesive, and then through extrusion, molding, injection molding and
        other plastic processing technologies to produce plates or profiles.

        One of the most important uses of wood-plastic composites is the
        application of replacing solid wood in various fields, among which the
        most widely used is in building products, accounting for 75% of the
        total number of wood-plastic composite products. Wood-plastic composites
        are mainly used in flower boxes, tree ponds, fences, garbage cans,
        stools, chair strips, signs, etc.

        Milk plastic is a natural plastic alternative that uses discarded milk
        as the main ingredient. The plastic is made in a similar way to cheese,
        using waste milk combined with natural plasticizers to coagulate and dry
        into granular materials.

        1. Sustainability: Milk plastic uses waste milk as the main raw material
        to transform waste resources into useful products, helping to reduce the
        environmental impact of waste and reducing dependence on finite
        resources, making it more sustainable.
        <br />
        <br />
        2. Lower carbon footprint: The process of making milk plastic reduces
        CO2 emissions compared to traditional plastic manufacturing processes.

        3. Biodegradability: Milk plastic is more similar to natural materials
        in structure, so it can be more easily decomposed by microorganisms,
        reducing pollution to the environment. In contrast, traditional
        synthetic plastics typically take hundreds of years or more to degrade.
        <br />
        <br />
        4. Diversity and plasticity: Milk plastic has similar properties to
        traditional plastics, and can be made into products of various shapes
        and uses through different processing methods, including containers,
        tableware, household items, etc. In addition, it can also be latheized
        and machined like wood, with a wider range of application prospects.
        <br />
        <br />
        5. Reduced dependence on fossil fuels: Making milk plastic does not
        require the use of fossil fuels as a feedstock, so it can reduce
        dependence on finite fossil resources and reduce the damaging impact on
        the environment.

        Aluminum foam plate is made of pure aluminum or aluminum alloy after
        adding additives, through the foaming process, which has both metal and
        bubble characteristics, and the surface of the aluminum plate has a
        dense porous metal structure, which is the largest morphological feature
        of this material. Aluminum foam board provides more choices for
        architects due to its stable quality, unique appearance, strong
        functionality, and wide variety of specifications, and is often used in
        a large area in the interior and exterior walls of buildings, indoor
        floors and other scenes, and the material is easy to process and
        install.

        Because of the special structure formed in the production process, the
        foam aluminum sheet has good sound absorption performance, even in the
        humid environment of the bathroom and toilet, the material still
        maintains a good sound absorption and noise reduction effect, which is
        more than double the noise reduction effect of other sound absorption
        materials.

        Aluminum metal has good flame retardant and heat resistance, and a large
        area of foam aluminum panels are laid on indoor and outdoor walls,
        columns and other blocks, which is equivalent to forming an efficient
        fire zone in the space, especially in large private houses, exhibition
        halls and other buildings, which can effectively improve the indoor and
        outdoor fire coefficient.

  >
    a.[Landfill]:
    <br />
    This is a traditional treatment method, but there are problems, such as the
    small density and large volume of plastics, which are not easy to decompose,
    resulting in difficulties in groundwater infiltration and secondary
    pollution of land. In addition, landfills have limited capacity to process
    waste, and plastic waste landfills lead to low resource utilization.
    <br />
    <br />
    b.[Incineration]:
    <br />
    Incineration can produce heat energy, but it will produce toxic and harmful
    gases, which requires advanced waste incineration equipment to ensure
    effective combustion and reduce harmful gas emissions. However, the
    incineration of plastic waste can cause serious pollution to the
    environment, especially the emission of heavy metal compounds.
    <br />
    <br />
    c.[Recycling]:
    <br />
    Recycling is an effective way to reduce environmental pollution and waste of
    resources. Through processes such as sorting, washing, and granulating,
    plastic waste can be reprocessed into new plastic products. This approach
    helps to reduce resource consumption and environmental pollution.
    <br />
    <br />
    d.[Pyrolysis]:
    <br />
    Pyrolysis is a chemical decomposition method that converts waste plastics
    into high value-added energy products such as fuel oil and carbon black.
    This method is suitable for plastic waste that is difficult to recycle or
    pyrolyze, but requires advanced equipment and processes.
    <br />
    <br />
    e.[Chemical]:
    <br />
    Treatment Chemical treatment involves the use of chemical methods to degrade
    plastic waste, such as photochemical reactions under ultraviolet light. This
    approach is not common in practical applications, but it has potential.

        PMOLED stands for Passive matrix OLED.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you compare OLED to LCD. PMOLED is like STN LCD; Active matrix OLED;
        AMOLED) is like a TFT LCD. The former is less suitable for displaying
        moving images, with a relatively slow response time, making it difficult
        to develop medium- and large-sized panels, but it is relatively
        power-efficient. The latter is faster in response and can be developed
        in various sizes of applications, up to the needs of TV panels, but it
        consumes more power than passive.
        <br />
        <br />
        The passive method has a simple structure, and the driving current
        determines the gray scale, resolution and image quality performance, and
        is mostly monochrome and multi-color products, and is used in
        small-sized products. The production cost and technical threshold of
        passive OLED are low, but the resolution cannot be improved due to the
        driving mode, so the size of the application product is limited to about
        5&quot;, and the product will be limited to the low-resolution and
        small-size market. If you want to develop into larger-size applications,
        PMOLED will have the problems of power consumption and reduced lifespan,
        and it is rarely applied on the main screen.

    2. Polyethylene (PE): This material is widely used to make films, pipes,
    bags, etc. Because it has good corrosion resistance, it is often used as a
    packaging material. For example, the plastic bags we use when shopping are
    made of polyethylene.
    <br />
    3. Polystyrene (PS): This material is commonly used to make bowls, plates,
    and cups, among other things. Because it has a good hardness and gloss, it
    is often used to make beautiful tableware.
    <br />
    4. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) :P VC is a relatively common plastic material,
    which is often used to make water pipes, door and window guards,
    children&#039;s toys, etc. It is also widely used in the manufacture of some
    insulated electrical components.
    <br />
    5. Polycarbonate (PC): This material is often used to make some of the more
    advanced containers, such as computer cases and coffee makers. It has great
    durability and impact resistance, and is able to withstand drastic changes
    in temperature.
    <br />
    6. Polyoxymethylene (POM): This material is often used to make some parts
    with special properties, such as high-efficiency bearings and gears. It has
    high hardness and good wear resistance.

        , the material is lightweight, the density is half of that of glass,
        when used in the home, it can give the space a certain sense of
        lightness and agility, and it will not be heavy when used.

        b.Reasons for favoring 
        <br />
        1.Wide range of applications.
        <br />
        Due to the superior performance of acrylic itself, in addition to being
        used as a variety of interior decoration, it can also be used to create
        a partial appearance of buildings, or used to make doors and windows on
        vehicles.
        <br />
        2.Beautiful and stylish
        <br />
        For different home styles, acrylic furniture or decorations can find
        their own home and blend in well.

        And the texture of its material is as rich and varied as it is presented
        itself, with mirror panels, pearlescent plates, frosted boards and other
        options, and the spatial effects presented by each texture also have
        their own merits.
        <br />
        In the process of integrating into the space, choosing a random texture
        of furniture or decorations is enough to create a focal point for the
        space and make the whole space look beautiful and stylish.

        e.Processing technology of acrylic sheet
        <br />
        (1) Casting molding:
        <br />
        Casting molding is used to form plexiglass plates, rods and other
        profiles, that is, to form profiles by bulk polymerization method.
        <br />
        (2) Injection molding:
        <br />
        Injection molding uses pellets obtained by suspension polymerization,
        which are molded on ordinary plunger or screw injection molding
        machines.
        <br />
        (3) Extrusion:
        <br />
        Polymethyl methacrylate can also be extruded to prepare plexiglass
        plates, rods, pipes, sheets, etc. with pellets produced by suspension
        polymerization, which has the advantage of high production efficiency,
        especially for pipes and other profiles that are difficult to
        manufacture with molds when pouring method.
        <br />
        (4) Thermoforming:
        <br />
        Thermoforming is the process of making plexiglass sheets or sheets into
        products of various sizes and shapes, clamping the blanks cut into the
        required size on the mold frame, heating to soften them, and then
        pressurizing them to make them stick to the mold profile to obtain the
        same shape as the profile, and trimming the edge after cooling and
        shaping to obtain the product.
        <br />
        (5) Engraving and cutting:
        <br />
        It is mainly for the hollowing and engraving of acrylic or colored
        acrylic materials that have been formed. Ordinary laser engraving and
        cutting machines can meet the engraving and hollowing needs of most
        acrylic products

        1. [Anodizing]:
        <br />
        Mainly the anodizing of aluminum, it is the use of electrochemical
        principles to generate a layer of Al2O3 (alumina) film on the surface of
        aluminum and aluminum alloys. This oxide film has special
        characteristics such as protection, decoration, insulation, and wear
        resistance.

        : At present, the color is limited, only black, gray and other more
        mature, bright colors are difficult to achieve at present; The cost is
        mainly affected by the high power consumption, which is one of the
        highest costs in surface treatment
