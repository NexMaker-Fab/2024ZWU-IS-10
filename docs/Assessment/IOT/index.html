          The intelligent home security system realizes real-time monitoring and
          protection of the home environment through various sensors and
          networking equipment. With the help of Internet of Things technology,
          this system realizes the intelligent and remoteization of home security.
          <br />
          <br />
          First of all, install door and window sensors on doors and windows. When
          doors and windows are opened abnormally, an alarm message will be sent
          to the user&#039;s mobile phone immediately. Secondly, the room is
          equipped with a high-definition camera, which can remotely view the
          situation at home in real time, and also has a mobile detection
          function. Once abnormal activity is detected, the alarm will be
          triggered immediately. In addition, smoke alarms and gas alarms can
          detect smoke and gas leaks in time and quickly notify users to take
          measures. Finally, the smart door lock is not only convenient for users
          to unlock, but also records the unlocking record. If there is any
          abnormal unlocking behavior, an alarm will also be issued.

          1. Door and window sensors: Magnetic sensors are generally used to
          determine the opening and closing state of doors and windows by
          detecting changes in magnetic fields.
          <br />
          <br />
          2. Smoke alarm: Photoelectric smoke sensor or ion smoke sensor is mostly
          used. The former detects the scattering of light by smoke to alarm,
          while the latter works by detecting the impact of smoke on ions.
          <br />
          <br />
          3. Gas alarm: Semiconductor gas sensor or catalytic combustion gas
          sensor is usually used. The former is sensitive to the change of
          conductivity of a specific gas, and the latter uses the heat generated
          by the combustion of combustible gas on the surface of the catalyst to
          detect.

          Common methods include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, etc. Wi-Fi transmission
          speed is fast and has a wide coverage range, but the power consumption
          is relatively high; Bluetooth power consumption is low, which is
          suitable for short-distance transmission; Zigbee has the characteristics
          of low power consumption, self-networking, etc., which is suitable for
          large-scale device connection.

          1. Sensor and data analysis
          <br />
          <br />
          • Hikvision uses various sensors in IoT, such as cameras, temperature
          sensors, humidity sensors, etc., to collect a large amount of data.
          Through advanced data analysis technology, these data are processed and
          mined, valuable information is extracted, and support security
          decision-making.
          <br />
          <br />
          2. Edge computing and intelligent terminals
          <br />
          <br />
          • Integrate edge computing power into security equipment to enable local
          data processing and analysis, reducing data transmission delay and
          dependence on the cloud. For example, the smart camera can detect and
          identify targets at the front end, and only upload key information to
          the cloud.
          <br />
          <br />
          3. Application of communication technology
          <br />
          <br />
          • Adopt a variety of IoT communication technologies, such as Wi-Fi,
          Bluetooth, Zigbee, etc., to realize the interconnection between security
          devices. At the same time, it also uses the high-speed and low-latency
          characteristics of 5G technology to improve the efficiency of remote
          monitoring and data transmission.

          1. Intelligent security Internet of Things platform
          <br />
          <br />
          • A comprehensive Internet of Things platform has been created to
          connect different types of security equipment to unified management, and
          realize centralized monitoring, remote control and intelligent
          scheduling of equipment.
          <br />
          <br />
          2. Smart home security
          <br />
          <br />
          • Combined with IoT technology, a series of smart home security products
          have been launched, such as smart door locks, smart cameras, smart
          sensors, etc., to provide all-round security protection and convenient
          life experience for home users.
          <br />
          <br />
          3. Smart city security
          <br />
          <br />
          • In the construction of smart cities, the integration of urban-level
          security systems is realized through IoT, including traffic monitoring,
          public area monitoring, environmental monitoring, etc., to improve the
          overall security and management efficiency of the city.

          1. Data security and privacy protection
          <br />
          <br />
          • With IoT devices collecting and transmitting a large amount of data,
          data security and user privacy protection have become important
          challenges. Hikvision needs to strengthen measures such as data
          encryption, access control and security authentication to ensure the
          security of user data.
          <br />
          <br />
          2. Industry standards and compatibility
          <br />
          <br />
          • The IoT industry lacks unified standards, and there are problems with
          compatibility between different devices and systems. Hikvision should
          actively participate in the formulation of industry standards and
          promote product compatibility and interoperability.
          <br />
          <br />
          3. Cyber security threats
          <br />
          <br />
          • The increase of IoT devices also brings more network security risks,
          such as hacker attacks, malware, etc. Hikvision needs to strengthen its
          network security protection capabilities and constantly update and
          improve its security strategy.
