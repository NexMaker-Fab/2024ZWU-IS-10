          On August 23, the Capital Aerospace Machinery Co., Ltd. released news
          that it has made important progress in the metal 3D printing
          manufacturing of rocket engines. The paper points out that Capital
          Aerospace Machinery Co., Ltd. has successfully realized the additive
          manufacturing of the inner wall test parts of the thrust chamber body of
          a certain engine. The product has a diameter of 600 mm and a height of
          850 mm, which is the largest overall additive manufacturing copper alloy
          body product publicly reported at present, and its successful
          development also marks that the company has become the first unit in
          China to fully master the large-size chrome-zirconium copper alloy laser
          selective melting additive manufacturing technology.
          <br />
          Thrust chamber, as the core component of rocket engine, is a typical
          complex and precise component. In the past, the production of thrust
          chamber body structure involved a complicated process, the manufacturing
          cycle was at least 6 months, the reliability was insufficient, and the
          production cost was high. In order to adapt to the new situation of
          high-intensity density launch, gradually achieve &quot;improving
          quality, reducing cost and increasing efficiency&quot;, and enhance
          competitive advantage, the research on additive manufacturing technology
          of thrust chamber body has been put on the agenda. Laser selective
          melting technology has high forming precision and is the &quot;best
          choice&quot; for additive manufacturing of complex structure thrust
          chamber body.

          The first study on 3D printing technology published in Science in 2023
          was published on January 5. A research team led by Tao Sun, associate
          professor of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of
          Virginia, has made the discovery that a method to detect keyhole
          generation by integrating experimental data, multi-physics simulation,
          and machine learning is able to capture the unique thermal features
          associated with keyhole generation with sub-milliseconal time resolution
          and a 100% prediction rate.
          <br />
          Researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory have developed a way to
          combine post-inspection data from printed parts with information
          collected by sensors during the printing process, and the combined data
          teaches machine learning algorithms to identify defects in products.
          This new method achieves a 90% detection rate, which is consistent with
          the defect detection probability of traditional evaluation methods, thus
          saving time and reducing costs.

          1) EOS has introduced a new Smart Fusion solution for the Laser Powder
          Bed Melting (LPBF)3D printing process, which visually detects potential
          build issues and automatically adjusts laser power so that the entire
          printing process is stable and reliable without the use of support,
          resulting in more uniform and consistent parts.
          <br />
          <br />
          2) Platite said that it has broken through the unsupported metal 3D
          printing process and can achieve unsupported printing of overhanging
          structures below 30°;
          <br />
          <br />
          3) Huashu Hi-tech released the self-developed SLM less support
          technology. The closed impeller printed by this technology can reduce
          the support amount by 99.8%, and the internal and external 25° bevel
          structure can be successfully formed without support;
          <br />
          <br />
          4) Easyplus 3D independently developed unsupported metal 3D printing
          process, can print AlSi10Mg, titanium alloy and other common materials,
          can achieve 120μm thick layer printing.
          <br />
          <br />
          5) Suzhou Baifeng Intelligent based on the &quot;Pre-Scan&quot; concept,
          the development of unsupported printing technology, the current Baifeng
          has achieved 15° and above Angle unsupported printing.
          <br />
          <br />
          6) Hanbang Technology research and development team has conducted
          research and exploration of metal 3D printing unsupported technology,
          and can achieve 15-25° tilt features of unsupported forming.
          <br />
          <br />
          7) 3D Systems has also made a breakthrough in the unsupported LPBF
          process.
