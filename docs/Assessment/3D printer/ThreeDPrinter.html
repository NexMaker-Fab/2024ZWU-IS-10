        On August 23, the Capital Aerospace Machinery Co., Ltd. released news
        that it has made important progress in the metal 3D printing
        manufacturing of rocket engines. The paper points out that Capital
        Aerospace Machinery Co., Ltd. has successfully realized the additive
        manufacturing of the inner wall test parts of the thrust chamber body of
        a certain engine. The product has a diameter of 600 mm and a height of
        850 mm, which is the largest overall additive manufacturing copper alloy
        body product publicly reported at present, and its successful
        development also marks that the company has become the first unit in
        China to fully master the large-size chrome-zirconium copper alloy laser
        selective melting additive manufacturing technology.
        <br />
        Thrust chamber, as the core component of rocket engine, is a typical
        complex and precise component. In the past, the production of thrust
        chamber body structure involved a complicated process, the manufacturing
        cycle was at least 6 months, the reliability was insufficient, and the
        production cost was high. In order to adapt to the new situation of
        high-intensity density launch, gradually achieve &quot;improving
        quality, reducing cost and increasing efficiency&quot;, and enhance
        competitive advantage, the research on additive manufacturing technology
        of thrust chamber body has been put on the agenda. Laser selective
        melting technology has high forming precision and is the &quot;best
        choice&quot; for additive manufacturing of complex structure thrust
        chamber body.

        The first study on 3D printing technology published in Science in 2023
        was published on January 5. A research team led by Tao Sun, associate
        professor of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of
        Virginia, has made the discovery that a method to detect keyhole
        generation by integrating experimental data, multi-physics simulation,
        and machine learning is able to capture the unique thermal features
        associated with keyhole generation with sub-milliseconal time resolution
        and a 100% prediction rate.
        <br />
        Researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory have developed a way to
        combine post-inspection data from printed parts with information
        collected by sensors during the printing process, and the combined data
        teaches machine learning algorithms to identify defects in products.
        This new method achieves a 90% detection rate, which is consistent with
        the defect detection probability of traditional evaluation methods, thus
        saving time and reducing costs.

        Unsupported metal 3D printing
        <br />
        <br />
        In recent years, through years of continuous research and development
        and repeated trials, Jinshi 3D core technology team, under the
        leadership of chief scientist Professor Yang Yongqiang, has made
        important breakthroughs in the field of unsupported metal 3D printing:
        Breaking the 45° limit and developing a universally applicable
        unsupported low Angle forming method to achieve the effective forming of
        industrial parts in large overhang areas, has successfully printed
        unsupported metal impellers and other samples with the lowest Angle of
        15°, providing application solutions for many industries.
        <br />
        <br />
        In February 2024, Professor Yang Yongqiang and Professor Wang Di of
        South China University of Technology, the core scientific research team
        of Jinshi 3D, jointly published an invited paper entitled &quot;Research
        on the Method and process of Laser Selective Melting Forming of
        Low-angle Unsupported Structures&quot; in the journal of China Laser.
        The forming mechanism, the surface quality of the sample and the
        applicability of the forming method of unsupported metal printing were
        investigated, and the actual industrial parts were used for printing
        verification.
